### What I Learn
* You'll be flexing your value-returning `function` muscles.
* And you'll be trying your hand at:
  * Literal `boolean` values.
  * The unary `not` operator (`!`).
  * The binary `boolean` operators (`&&` and `||`).
________
##*Twolean - Boolean Comparisons*##
* Write a function called moreThan5 that takes in a number and returns whether or not it's greater than 5.
* Write a function called isFailing that takes in a grade (as a number) and returns whether or not it's below 60.
* Write a function called isMiddleSchoolTeacher that takes in a role (as a string) and a level (as a number) and returns whether they're both a teacher and the level they teach at is 6 to 8 inclusive.

* Steps
1. Call getInput TWICE to get the first name and the last name. See the extensive comments in main.js on how to use this pre-written helper function. Store the return values in variables.
2. Create a function to get initials. It should take in two strings (a first name and a last name) and return one string with initials. Manually test it with the following inputs:
3. Call that function, passing in the user's inputs from step 1. Store the result in a variable.
4. Calculate the combined length of the first name and the second name. For example, for 'Colin' and 'Jaffe', we should get 10. Store that in another variable.
5. Create a message that follows the format from the output outlined in the Workflow section. Store that message string in a variable.
5. Pass that string into console.log to print out your result.
6. Test your app by calling it with node/nodemon.
